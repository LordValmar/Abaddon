Valmod Nightmare Edition was created by world-renowned mod author Valmar. The
mod incorporates ideas from other mods such as Spider's True Survival. Also
included are custom POIs from Magoli and Co's CompoPack. Thanks to all!

This mod was commissioned by the admins of 7 Days to Die server "Zombies of
Abaddon." If you want to play, just search in your game browser for "abaddon"
and you will find us :-)

The Nightmare Edition is specifically designed to provide a more difficult
environment, but hopefully also alleviates some of the more "grindy" aspects
of the default game. 

New features and fixes are added all the time, so be sure you have the latest
version. You can find the latest at "https://github.com/LordValmar/Abaddon" or
on our website "http://zombiesofabaddon.enjin.com"
